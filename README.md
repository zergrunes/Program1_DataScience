Instructions: Given the rainfall.txt file, which consists of a city name and a rainfall value in inches, write a python codes for the following tasks:

1. A function that returns (city, rainfall_value) for the city with the highest/largest rainfall;
2. A function that returns (city, rainfall_value) for the city with the lowest/smallest rainfall;
3. A function that returns the mean rainfall value;
4. A function that returns the number of cities with rainfall greater than the mean value;
5. A main function that opens the text file, reads in data (each line is a city and its rainfall in inches), convert the rainfall data to centimeter, then call each of the above function to get the required result. _Display each result in proper format and in the unit of centimeters._
6. Call the main function to run the program

NOTE: the "draft.py" are just other parts of the code that I didn't use / figure out
